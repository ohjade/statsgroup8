Can't use decomposition function because data is not long enough/lacks seasonality, which i guess should be expected? The functions are unable to detect a clear periodic pattern in the time series
```{r}
# Testing out some decomposition functions, but none of them seem to work. Just leaving them in here for future ref.

# decomposition <- decompose(ts_flies)
# decomposition_stl <- stl(ts_flies, s.window = "periodic")
#

# decomposition <- seas(ts_para)
# plot(decomposition)
